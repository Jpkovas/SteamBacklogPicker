# TODO

- Cache Epic hero art locally when only remote URIs exist so offline sessions still have covers available.
- Localize the new launch/install error messages emitted by the launch service.
- Add regression coverage for the new Epic entitlement and metadata fetchers to guard token parsing and GraphQL parsing behaviors.
